// gridTraveler memoization
// Say that you are traveller on a 2D grid.you begin on top-left corner and your goal is to travel to bottom right corner.
// you can only move down or right.
// Count number of ways you can travel to the goal on a grid with dimensions( m*n)
// Write a function gridTraveller(m,n) that does this.

// Edge cases
// gridTraveller(1,1) => 1 (one way to travel -start is same as end)
// gridTraveller(m,0) => zero ways ( Invalid grid if one of dimensions is zero there is no grid, Zero colums one row)
// gridTraveller(0,n) => zero ways
