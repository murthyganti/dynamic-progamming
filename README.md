# dynamic-progamming
Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving an optimization problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to its subproblems

Learn Dynamic Progamming by solving Algorithmic Problems &amp; Coding Challenges
This is based on this amazing free course by Alvin Zablan on [freeCodeCamp course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk) . I stronly suggest take advantage of it.
